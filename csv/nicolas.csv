Rumour: Papers & Global Warming Myth,
"Of course we know that. But the deniers who share this all over social media already regard Snopes as biased and untrustworthy (can't imagine why!). Climate Feedback also had an analysis back when his list was only 58 papers (now it's just much more of the same). But, since that site also pokes holes in denier arguments, it's also ""biased and untrustworthy.""",Disbelieve
"It is not a impossible task for the average person to read and understand much of the science behind these papers. The fact that many are not prepared to do this is a reflection on our current education system and our national priorities. We already know (through scientific study) that people naturally select information that reinforces their already formed opinions and ignore that which tends to contradict it. Only a passion for truth wherever it leads can counter this. It is unclear to me how such a passion can be generally fostered, but I do see evidence that it can happen.",Neutral
"Unfortunately this has nothing to do with honest science debate. Delingpole publishes clickbait, knowing full well that his audience won't read the science itself; they'll merely copy/paste/share all over the internet, increasing ad revenue. That's all that matters; that's the business model. It's just another way of making money off of ignorance.",Disbelieve
"I'm always wondering in the back of my mind if the climate-denial propagandists are directly on the payroll of the fossil fuels companies. Once in a while a document leaks out and we find out that a big chunk of them are. Hasn't happened to Dellingpole yet that I can tell, but I wouldn't be surprised if it turned out to be the case.",Disbelieve
"lol Delingpole at it again, that fucking dumb wanker isn't fooling anyone, especially at this point with the temps as abnormally hot as ever. He sure gets plenty of clicks from right winger snowflakes though, which lines his pockets quite nicely.",Disbelieve
Fact check: Science can't prove a negative.,Neutral
"Good refutation. It's the usual mix of misrepresentations and quote mines not relevant to human-induced warming (the comments from the some of the studies' authors are pretty revealing), predatory journals and unpublished commentary. Only thing I'll add is that the Snopes author doesn't make it clear that the Reynolds 2016 study is only about North Atlantic trends, not ""global warming trend"" as he states. Fig. 11 is ""northeast Atlantic SSTs"", and indeed the data is detrended. Pseudoskeptics rarely if ever contact authors of papers they're spinning. They have no interest in really learning anything.",Disbelieve
"Delingpole has responded to this in Breitbart. I say responded, he basically admits to just copying a blog post without checking any of the claims. Somehow he manages to couch this confession in the most condescending tones, as though he hasn't just been caught failing the most basic requirements of journalism. What an odious little shit of a man he is.",Disbelieve
"Would you rather let the MSM go wild on this over exaggerated claim or lose your job because you don't get money if there isn't a problem. I don't know anyone who believes that climate change does/will happen, its how we had the ice age etc etc, but it is not speeding up or going to end the world in our lifetime let alone in human's lifetime on this earth.",Neutral
"I suspect if one did a large survey of articles in the MSM, there would be a very small percentage found that stated the Earth will be ending, and we could find a much greater set of articles claiming there's no real problem, or that reducing emissions will cause economic catastrophe. That's where most of the genuine alarmism and exaggerations are.",Believe
"How could you possibly now that? There has never been 7 billion humans in the planet, let alone 7 billion humans extracting hundreds of millions of years worth of stored carbon and chucking haphazardly into the atmosphere over less than one hundred years. Now, very clear and fundamental physics demand that the Earth warms faster and hotter than it has in thousands of years, maybe millions. Your assumption that the impact will have is small goes contrary to everything that can be observed in nature. The only way that can be accepted as real is if you assume that the earth must remain in a state favorable to humans. There is nothing in the known universe to point to that. You are deluding yourself. I dont blame you. That is much easier than to accept the coming destruction is induced by the way we choose to power the wonderful way we live.",Neutral
"“its not earth ending, our little blue/green rock will live on long after we've left.” That's true. Climate change is a threat to the human species (and not the planet Earth's existence) in the very least, our quality of life and economy. The planet's composition will change (particularly with rising sea levels, weather events, and some species' extinction affecting local ecologies) but won't blow up from Climate Change. However, the concern about climate change is that it will ruin cities by oceans (which is most big cities), drastically affect our food supply (particularly agriculture), and make natural disasters even worse than they already are. It's a selfish concern in that it's focused on humans. But I don't think that is a bad thing.",Believe
"I guess if you're argument is that climate change is no big deal because it won't end all life on Earth, you're technically on solid ground.",Neutral
"“but it is not speeding up...” It most certainly is speeding up. 1.53 degrees Fahrenheit (0.85 degrees Celsius) on average since 1880. After the last Ice Age, it took over 2000 years to warm up that much. All evidence proves that this rapid increase is due to the huge increase of carbon in the atmosphere, and that carbon boost is directly related to industrialization. This isn't speculation, this is fact. Here is a cute yet accurate diagram to demonstrate the warm-up... https://xkcd.com/1732/",Neutral

"In science if you can definitively, rigorously show that the accepted theory is wrong, you get awards and get into history books. If you decide the theory is wrong and use poor methodology to “prove” it, well, you won’t get a real science job, but you can make a lot of money working for companies or think tanks that stand to gain from denying science.",Disbelieve
"They got money before there was a problem and they likely won't get much money now that there is a problem and there's deniers in the white house. If anything, it would be in their financial interest to lie and say that there is no climate change.",Disbelieve
"Meanwhile those tiny mom and pop oil shops can barely afford rent much less lobbying and PR. Most Climate Scientists would be out of a job if we decided to curb emissions and be good stewards of our home. It makes no sense. If you're right they'd be better off agreeing with you and saying they need more funds to study what's really going on. The only reason they still have jobs is our inaction. They come out with a good model based on current trends and predicted curbing then have to start over as we not only fail to curb but increase emissions. Oil, Gas, and Coal companies have a much stronger financial motive. It's weird how nobody who brings up the big green energy lobby wants to acknowledge this. Nobody is claiming the world will end, you don't even understand what you're arguing against. At current trends though, life as we know it will be much more difficult.

Rumour: Cholera in Puerto Rico,
"This is why a massive relief effort was needed early. Those crucial first few days are when you need to get clean water, food and sanitation to people. FFS, the administration had a WEEK to prepare and we knew for several days prior that a major hurricane (Cat 3+) was likely to hit Puerto Rico dead on. And they're just now, 10 days later, sending the US Navy hospital ship. They just identified a general to organize efforts. They've still not sent even the amount of troops and supplies we had in Haiti which, who knew?, is NOT an American protectorate. Trump didn't even have a meeting on the situation until Tuesday, nearly a week after the storm landed. There was no coordinated plan. It's inexcusable. No American of any political ideology should accept this. Meanwhile the Twitter Toddler is victim blaming Puerto Ricans while people die.",Believe
"There are some horrible people out there and social media has given them a huge microphone. This shouldn't be a remotely political situation: people (Americans, even) are without the basic necessities of life and in mortal danger. We've got the biggest and best-supplied military in the world. Fucking fix it.",Believe

"I was hoping, sadly enough, that ""outbreak"" in the title meant violence among people, and not this. But the mix of unsanitary conditions, lack of potable water, and tropical temperatures, this is why action was needed immediately.",Believe
"Even irrespective of his corruption and collusion, Trump should be impeached AND thrown in prison over intentionally allowing American citizens to die through his willful apathy on the subject. Anyone who stands against his removal at this point is evil for continuing to provide cover for this monster.",Believe
"For those who aren't familiar with cholera, it's more or less what wiped out Napoleon's army when he started his Russia campaign. Almost half of the Grand Army was lost before getting to Moscow, a fair portion of that due to cholera.

"I just listened to the Governor of the Virgin Islands on MSNBC. He said that Trump expressed concern about the situation in Puerto Rico. So in private conversations, Trump is acknowledging shit is bad, but publicly he's attacking the Mayor of San Juan, blaming American citizens for not fixing the problems themselves, yet somehow telling the world that everything in Puerto Rico is ""GOING GREAT!!!""",Believe
"That could be bad. It shows some concern, but not from empathy for the victims, but for being wrong in his claims. So his reaction could be to double down to further emphasize he was right to begin with. Or he could come out and say he was wrong before, and he was trying to fix his mistakes.

"Krugman said that cases of cholera had been reported in Puerto Rico. By his own account, that was incorrect. He assumed someone he trusted had verified the facts and the person hadn't. Health care professionals raised the concern that massive damage to the water supply system increased the risk of cholera, but that falls well short of an actual outbreak. While references to a cholera outbreak littered the twittersphere, those accounts were being rejected two days before Krugman’s tweet.",Disbelieve
I think it was a combination of there being a lot more damage due to Puerto Rico's poor infrastructure and the lack of a speedy response from the federal government.,Believe
"Well, the people who are particularly in need of that aid likely aren't on the internet right now. Either because they don't have it back or because they have more pressing problems to deal with. I've heard from a few people in PR and it's not great for them but they're all in the San Juan area, not some remote town/village that's where the real crisis is likely going on if there is one.",Believe
"Combination of really destructive hurricanes and a lackluster response from the White House. While we won't know until a while after how the bungling compares, the sentiment right now is a lot like the controversy over FEMA and Katrina.",Neutral
"The response as far as I've been tracking has been centered largely on the capital of San Juan and even there it's largely been insufficient. People are still without power, food is scarce, and without air conditioning all on a sweltering tropical island. And this isn't even mentioning the more remote, harder to get to, parts of the country that are most susceptible to contagious outbreaks of stuff like cholera.",Neutral
"As far as I can tell, they're going decently, given the nature of the problem (a relatively poor existing infrastructure that was then annihilated by the hurricane) . That isn't to say that things aren't terrible on the ground, but that they're going about as well as could be expected. There probably isn't much objectivity on the matter, particularly from the left-wing big-media outlets who have a huge psychological stake in making the president look as bad as possible.",Neutral
"Be aware. The media and the American Left are looking for an/any opportunity to make Trump look bad. With Puerto Rico, they are trying to create a narrative that will stick to his administration long after hurricane season is over. The one mayor, the mayor of San Juan, has been very critical but she's also not very credible - she's been called out by other mayors in PR (who say she's playing politics) and who say that help is indeed being provided. There is no reason to believe that, suddenly, Trump decided to treat Puerto Rico differently than Texas or Florida. That's just silly. (He was never called a racist until he decided to run for president, btw.). If you see news that keeps playing up the ""Trump is bad"" angle on every story, you can pretty much be sure that you're not getting the real story.",Disbelieve
"I think anyone in /r/PuertoRico who's managed to get cell or web access could tell you what's really going down, since English is actually widely used in that sub. Even then, I expect most of the input will come from the capital San Juan and the eastern part of the island. I've heard that the more rural western side is not getting as much attention, I guess because it's very hard to navigate with its mountainous terrain and thick vegetation.",Neutral

"Well, it depends on how you measure it.   **As a raw number** it's *technically* the largest because the US economy is the largest it has ever been and there is no effort to adjust the number accordingly; but this raw number is meaningless without the context of inflation or the economy and so it doesn't tell us anything useful.  **As an inflation-adjusted raw number**, it's somewhere in the middle, but this number doesn't take account of the size of the economy and population now (very large) compared to its size during previous tax cuts (much smaller). This number is also misleading because you're not dividing the size of the cut by the number of people it's distributed amongst.  **As a percentage of GDP**—which is the true scientific measure—[it's not even close](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/26/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-his-tax-plan-biggest-cut-ever/) to being the biggest tax cut in history. In fact, the current GOP tax proposal to relieve 0.8% of GDP ranks all the way down with the Revenue Act of 1978; so far from being the largest in history, it's actually dwarfed by the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (2.89%).  In order for the current GOP tax proposal to be in the same league as Reagan's, it would have to cut $6.8 trillion over 10 years. That means reducing the size of government: fewer social programs, less research and a smaller military.",Neutral

"It's so frustrating too because it's so obvious that we have to reform entitlements, but whenever you talk about cutting spending, the left always talks about the military.

"Could they like not? I like just got into the middle class, very nice, would like to stay.",Believe
"Fewer brackets that are each a higher percentage of income than previously and a top end bracket that is lower than it was previously. So those just outside of the new standard deduction will see a lowering of taxes. 10% becomes 12% for the starting bracket, but that bracket starts at double the current income level with the new standard deduction, so this is a tax savings for the poor.  They are proposing to cut the 39% top end income tax bracket down to 35%. A 4% tax savings for earners who make more than $400,000 (I doubt many in here have that kind of income...) and rumor is that tax bracket will be pushed higher, so the ultra wealthy will actually be taxed at 25% for a larger chunk of their lower level income, too.  The second income bracket previously was at 15%, now it's proposed to start at 25%. While we don't know the proposed start range, we DO know there will be an absurdly smaller amount of tax revenue coming from the ultra wealthy, lower taxes for corporations, removal of the estate tax, and a small tax decrease on the working poor... so where do you imagine it will come from?  Also, while you might not have state income tax to deduct, you WOULD have higher property tax to compensate for that. While you might not currently deduct it if you don't have a mortgage, many others in your state would be.  Edit: Also where do you get that they are lowering the tax rate? Tax rates are expected to go UP in the middle class. Unless there are some massive, and I mean absolutely massive, cuts coming to government programs, in particular military spending as it is the largest chunk of our overall government budget, that money has to come from somewhere. Currently no such cuts are planned. Taxes can't be cut across the board and expect to not run into a massive deficit.",Disbelieve
" The 25% rate I heard will be after $150,000.00 for married and $75,000.00 for singles. That's what I heard.  Please, if you could, provide a source on this. If this is true, tax revenue for the US government as a whole will be getting cut by more than half. That's not sustainable by any means unless we cut just about every single social program, military, education and infrastructure program across the US. Literally EVERYTHING would have to be cut by more than half their current size and funding.  This would lead to complete destabilization of the US as we know it. Millions upon millions of government employees and any programs that are government funded to be out of jobs (figure every road maintenance crew would have labor cut to 1/3rd, as you can not reduce material costs, every police force, fire department etc cut by a similar amount, military neutered to absolutely nothing at all)...

"Trump wants to remove tax deduction options, then reduce the overall rate.  Basically this means that total tax revenue will probably stay about the same, but it will be much simpler for individuals and businesses to calculate their taxes. This simplification is something that conservatives have talked about doing for many years. Even if incoming tax revenue stays the same, it will make the economy a little bit more prosperous because people won't have to waste so many man-hours (time = money, remember) on calculating their taxes.",Believe

The problem is that roughly 48% of American households pay **nothing**. Additionally, an alarming few (10%) of the top earners pay over 80% of all taxes paid. That's the problem.  Redrawing these lines (the brackets) is meaningless until someone in Washington figures out that many hands make light work. My dad had an 8th grade education and got a GED while he served in the US Navy. Even HE understood that if half the people aren't working, then they're just a burden.

"Unless they are talking about significantly overhauling one or more of Medicare, Social Security, or Defense, then it simply cannot be considered a serious proposal toward deficit reduction. We could cut everything else from the budget besides those three things and it wouldn't matter from a deficit standpoint.  The irony is that the Republicans are forever talking about the welfare state and entitlements -- I just named the three biggest entitlement programs in the federal government, and they are all completely off the table for Republicans it seems.",Disbelieve
"Medicare and Social Security could easily be much more sustainable with a payroll tax hike on top earners, and actually taking in immigrants since our natives don't want to have kids at a replacement rate.  Oh, and start making childcare affordable.",Neutral
"People need to realize that sustainability of social security and the federal debt/deficit are two different things. There would be no talk about sustainability of social security if it was linked to the federal budget because then it'd always be sustainable until the government stops functioning.  Payroll taxes are not supposed to go toward fixing any federal debt. They're supposed to go toward social security and medicare. If social security needs more money, you should look at either increasing payroll taxes or cutting social security benefits, but social security isn't the one that creating that 17 trillion dollar debt. If people want to argue that we should vastly cut social security and medicare and transfer those payroll taxes toward the deficit, they can do that, but I'd say that's a pretty terrible idea.  To be fair, I wouldn't say there's no link between social security and the federal budget, but the link is a lot smaller than people realize.",Believe

There simply will not be enough charity supplied to meet demand in a private system, which is why the Feds administer things like SSI instead.

"Or as many said about the most recent elections to justify not voting for Clinton: The lesser of two evils is still evil.  Hell, I said it to myself. I hate that I had to vote for her, but I know what the consequences of refusing to vote can be. I went to Iraq because George Bush “won? in 2000. I joined the Marines back when I was *certain* that Gore would win.  I hate that our electoral system is this fucked up. I hate the choices it’s forced me into. I hate what it’s done to me and the country that I love, the people who live in it, and those on the other end of our extremely effective weapons systems.   There are degrees of shitty and evil though, and I can’t think of another administration which approaches this one in both. It’s like all the worst of Grant, Harding, Tyler, and Buchanan...except that they, along with Bush, were generally more incompetent and products of the times. We look back on them now and see that their jingoism and racism and fervor for slavery (as well as their devotion to machine politics and kickbacks which were just normal at the time) make them all directly responsible for the Civil War and slavery and the brutalities perpetrated against the Native Americans...some moreso than others.  But Trump is something special. He’s a racist out of time, an unapologetic pseudo-fascist who flirts with all of these notions which were invalidated at the cost of millions of lives *so long ago*. There is *no good reason* for him not to know better. As for Bush, one can argue that he was either too stupid, and controlled by evil men, or quite evil, but not too effective. After all, the War in Iraq was never anything approaching a genocide, it was never a massacre. It was ill-advised for certain, and it led directly to many of the problems we have been dealing with since: CIA black sites and torture, extra-territorial-extra-judicial detention centers, a shoddy response to Katrina.  Trump takes all of these mistakes and declares them mistaken only in the sense that they didn’t go far enough. He wants to put a guy in charge of the CIA who has declared that his biggest problem with Gitmo is that it’s too damned *humane*.  Don’t forget, even Nixon created the EPA.  On the other hand, I can’t think of one thing I have admired Trump for, one thing I have agreed with him over (which he hasn’t shortly revealed to be a devious lie) and I stopped forgiving him a long time ago. He is not fumbling through figuring out how to run the country which he wishes to serve out of love. He is just conning his way through every moment and working on the assumption that his supporters don’t care about reality, only about “triggering libs? while the Congress doesn’t give a damn what he does as long as the heat’s off them.  There’s no excuse for any of this.  Plus it’s only been a year. We haven’t even seen what the war he will start is going to look like...and I’d rather not.",Neutral

"Typically lowering taxes has been a driver of economic growth, after the first world war, after the recessions of the 70s. The only time that high taxes were present during high growth was around the second world war and this was a result of a massive focused effort by the entire country as a result of conflict.   What the US needs now is relatively low taxation, not for corporations and the wealthy only, but for everyone.  More taxation=more economic growth=higher tax base over time=more money for the budget.  Think of it like a lemon tree with lemons that aren't quite ready yet. You can leave the lemons to grow or you can pick them early and try to squeeze as much as you can from them.   The idea of lowering taxation to boost growth is a fairly sensible one. Government spending, unless it's on big projects like bridges, roads, is usually inefficient and wastes money. Give the markets time to breathe and get some real growth going.",Neutral

"I had a random shower thought the other day and was wondering what you guys might think of it. What if we got completely rid of taxes on all overtime work? It would definitely give me the incentive to work more overtime which could only be good for GDP. The rich aren't paid hourly so this would be effectively a tax cut only for the middle class, and only for that portion of the middle class who works hard to make this country run. The more overtime you work, the lower overall percentage of your earned wages ends up being taxed without taking anything out of the revenue stream for the government (they still get the same taxes from you that they would have had you not worked the overtime). Employers wouldn't be incentivized to fire people and just have people forced to work overtime since this only reduces the employee's tax burden, not the business'. With more people eager to work overtime at time and a half pay, this would incentivize businesses to hire more people which would create more jobs. All of this would be great for the economy and I've never heard any politician propose it.",Neutral

"""Well the stated intent today was that they will be revenue neutral when scored dynamically.""

The Romney/Ryan ticket said the exact thing about their tax plan even when independent economists said it would add significantly to the debt. ",Neutral
" What does scored dynamically mean? Havent heard that one, only caught bits pieces of the press conference  Dynamic scoring is a method for analyzing fiscal policy in such a way that focuses on hypothetical actions taken by individuals in response to incentives created by those policies. It's one of the primary justifications for supply-side economic tax policies- as supply-side supporters argue (as far as my limited understanding is), lower taxes for both corporations and individuals leads to higher and better economic activity. The combination of people and corporations having more money to spend with them spending it potentially leads to job and wealth creation. When people get richer, the government doesn't need to spend as much money on them.   A dynamic scoring of tax cuts can argue that although these cuts may initially seem costly to the government, they will save money in the long run from their benefits. On the other hand, a static scoring of tax cuts will just see them as less revenue for government expenditure.",Neutral
"Yep. I'm not a fan of the administration at all (check my history) but if it's actually successful in eliminating loopholes and sets the tax rate at 15%, and gets corporations to repatriate offshore funds (which we get 15% of) then I could actually see this as a tax increase. However, all that was released today was a one page memo that was very light on details. What the details are and whether any of this comes to fruition is a different story. We'll see I guess?",Neutral
There are lots of republicans in the house and Senate who say they would never vote for a tax increase even if it is only through the elimination of loopholes. Do you think they would be willing to do this?,Neutral
"It seems from my reading (e.g. http://www.npr.org/2017/04/26/525683530/4-questions-about-trumps-tax-plan) that the White House has claimed that the cuts will be revenue-neutral not because of closing loopholes but because they will stimulate growth.    We fundamentally believe we can get to 3 percent sustained economic growth, Mnuchin said Wednesday morning.  That's not a crazy number--average annual GDP growth in the 80s and 90s was over 3%, though back then population growth was also substantially higher (1-1.5%), meaning the total size of the economy also grew.   With population growth at an all-time low and the baby boomers aging out of the workforce, many economists (most prominently Robert Gordon: http://www.nber.org/papers/w18315) predict the age of high rates of growth to be over.   Perhaps more to this point, many analysts are skeptical that the current plan will be anywhere near revenue-neutral (e.g. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-26/white-house-unveils-trump-s-opening-bid-for-biggest-tax-cut).   What gives you such confidence that this will be the case? 3% growth isn't crazy (though Trump's promised 4% is quite unlikely), but it's improbable, no?",Believe
Do you believe in supply side economics? Looking at what happened to Kansas and Louisiana after corporate and income tax rates and it's pretty bad. Massive holes in revenue streams with no appreciable growth,Neutral
"Has anyone in the administration offered any details on which loop holes are going to be targeted and how much revenue they're going to bring in? Close loop holes seems to be a popular applause line on both sides of the aisle, but it also seems like it's only ever talked about vaguely. Maybe politicians do this because we all have different definitions of loop holes so everyone can imagine that the corporations who will be affected are the ones we think deserve to pay more. Presumably once the loop holes are specified, industry lobbyists will be out in full force trying to save them. Do you think Trump will be able to get support for specific loop holes and keep that support in the face of highly funded lobbyists?",Neutral
"But we cannot have it both ways, right?  If the loopholes are eliminated so that businesses are paying the same or more taxes despite a lower official taxrate, then you don't get the benefits of dynamic scoring/supply side.  Supply side only works if businesses actually save money, because ostensibly they put that money into investment which grows the economy in a manner that the size of the pie outpaces the smaller slice the government takes. If they don't save any money on taxes, there is no supply side benefit.  I feel like Trump has to make one argument or the other. Either it is a legit decreasing of taxes, in which case you make the supply side argument. Or, it's merely a simplification of tax codes (not a bad thing at all) but there is no economic revenue growth. In which case, he will have to reduce spending in order for his budget to be fiscally neutral.",Neutral

 Well the stated intent today was that they will be revenue neutral when scored dynamically.  you don't have an issue with this whole VooDoo numbers idea?

All of this isn't hyperbole -- it's exactly what my right-wing friends say every day on Facebook. It's what I read from online conservative commentators, on TV, and radio programs. As a whole, American conservatives have become mentally unstable, with a profoundly delusional. And not because they have different views, but because they believe in things that have no basis in reality and yet confirm what they ""know"" about our ""Marxist in Chief"" president.

The ""Obama is a Muslim"" thing boils down to the ""America is a Christian nation"" nonsense that seems to come out of the religious reich all the time. Since they think he's a Muslim, he clearly can't be running a Christian nation. Never mind that both claims above are completely false. But then, facts have a liberal bias anyway...

"“What about how 3 steel high rise buildings collapsed symmetrically straight down due to fire? Would fire (including plane impact) melt and weaken the structure so uniformly to produce this result, let alone 3 times?” This is an important question, and I believe the answer depends on where the fire is. Remember that heat rises, so the closer the fire is to the top of the building, the less likely it is to cause a total collapse. If you consider the north tower, for example, it was 110 floors high, and was impacted between floors 93 and 99, way above its centre of gravity. Hence, without explosives, you're left with the argument that those 17 floors suddenly and somehow gained enough weight to crush the undamaged 93 floor section beneath themselves. In other words, you're left with a physically impossible argument. And this is why 9/11 has f!cked me up so much. It's made me understand that truth is completely unimportant to the world we live in. We are governed by politics, and politics has effectively become the art of lying.",Believe

"To me, it's not even so much 9/11 itself that's so important... it's the implications. If you figure out 9/11 was an inside job, it logically follows that the western press is willing to lie, in concert, to conceal the mass murder of nearly 3,000 people AND to lie to promote wars that killed more than a million. Which implies that our news is not really news, but mere propaganda. And that implies that nearly all TV and movies, which support the original lie in subtle or not-so-subtle ways, are part of the propaganda network. And public education, which supports it, is part of it. As are many, if not most churches. This calls into question not only current events, but indeed our entire ""known"" history. It implies that the majority of the western world is living in a schizophrenic bubble, an artificial reality if you will, controlled by criminal oligarchs. (Indeed, most likely the whole world is kept within bubbles of various sorts... but I don't speak enough languages to be able to confirm.) To me, that's the real mindfuck of 9/11: We're living in an fake reality. Whoa. Once you know what really happened on 9/11, the whole deception just logically unravels. I suppose you could get there from Sandy Hook or Boston Bombing or even Alex Jones... but 9/11 is just such a straight shot.

That ""war"" was all about 9/11 at first, but there were still some legit journalists back then and it became plainly obvious Iraq had nothing to do with it - even most Americans believed that. So they quickly shifted it to ""WMD's"" and made up some intel along those lines (and tried to make it appear that UN inspectors were being blocked by Saddam). When it became clear to the moderately intelligent half of the world that this was also straight bullshit, they tried to claim it was because he was just a real bad guy, and tried to insist that Iraqi's wanted the US to come ""free"" them.
